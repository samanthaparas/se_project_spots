## Intro

This project was originally created to ensure all elements of the Spots interface displayed correctly across popular screen sizes and included full modal functionality for user interactions. In Spots Stage 9, the project has been upgraded to connect with a live REST API so that all user actions persist on the server.

The goal of this project is to apply all previously learned front-end concepts and integrate real asynchronous operations with the API.

### Key skills demonstrated include:

- Creating and organizing project blocks
- Structuring code across HTML, CSS, and modular JavaScript
- Building a fully responsive layout and attaching images/text dynamically
- Opening and closing popups with smooth, accessible interactions
- Allowing users to edit their profile info and avatar with server updates
- Adding new cards and displaying them instantly from API responses
- Deleting cards with a confirmation modal and removing them from both the DOM and server
- Viewing full-size images through interactive modals
- Liking and unliking cards with live updates from the API
- Implementing loading states (“Saving…”, “Deleting…”) for improved UX
- Using an Api class to manage all requests and handle errors gracefully

### Technologies & Techniques

- HTML5, semantic structure
- CSS3, BEM methodology, responsive layout
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), modules
- Fetch API & asynchronous JavaScript (Promise-based)
- REST API integration (CRUD operations for users and cards)
- Form validation with HTML5 Validity API
- Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, autoprefixer, cssnano
- Git, GitHub Pages deployment
