# Spots Stage 8

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Deployment

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In addition, I've added the functionality of the modals and users are able to enter in information. The purpose of this project is to be able to use all that was taught such as:

- Creating Blocks
- Structuring all code within HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Aligning, attaching images, responsive to different screen sizes
- Opening and closing modals smoothly
- Users can submit information into the input fields and have it reflect what was submitted
- Delete pictures off of the website
- Click on each picture to view it in it's original size
